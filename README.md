# FundApps API Spec & Examples

We provide a REST-ful HTTPS API for automated interfaces between your systems and our service. Our API uses predictable, resource-oriented URI's to make methods available and HTTP response codes to indicate errors. These built-in HTTP features, like HTTP authentication and HTTP verbs are part of the standards underpinning the modern web and are able to be understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients.

Our API methods return machine readable responses in XML format, including error conditions.

## Base URI
If your Rapptr installation is available at https://%company%.fundapps.co/ the URI from which your API is available is https://%company%-api.fundapps.co/. Ditto, staging api is available at https://%company%-staging-api.fundapps.co/
All requests made to our API must be over HTTPS.

## Authentication
You authenticate to the Rapptr API via [Basic Authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617) over HTTPS. A Rapptr administrator from your organisation must create a user with the role "API" for this purpose. You must authenticate for all requests.
**Note:** Please ensure you create a separate user for the API as if you use an existing user's account, as soon as they change their password the API upload will fail.

## Methods

A number of methods are available, depending on the kind of data being uploaded. Typically customers send us a position file once or more a day; other uploads are optional and depend on business requirements.

All of our API methods expect your upload file to be sent as the body of the request; our example implementations show how to achieve this with commonly used HTTP libraries.

### `POST /v1/expost/check`

Upload Daily Positions. This method expects to receive data in XML format ([example XML position files](Sample-XML/)); large files may be zipped. The response includes a link which when polled allows monitoring of the progress of processing the file.

#### Sample
    (Request Headers)
    POST https://%company%-api.fundapps.co/v1/expost/check HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: "application/xml"
    
    (Response)
    <links>
      <result>/v1/ExPost/Result/fe633307-f196-4609-abfe-a1fc0111e875</result>
    </links>

#### Position File XSD
We make an XSD schema available for the position upload XML format; this may be retrieved from the `GET /v1/expost/xsd` API endpoint on your Rapptr instance . If you don't have access to an instance yet and would like access to an XSD file, please [contact support](https://fundapps.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200951119-Contacting-Support).

### `GET /v1/expost/result/<guid>`

Check the progress of the rule processing on a position upload. As noted above, when uploading a position file the specific URI for checking progress is provided; the unique ID of the job is included in the URI.

This endpoint returns a `202 Accepted` HTTP status whilst the check is in progress and a `200 OK` status when the check is complete. The progress of validation and rule execution is reported separately in the response.

ValidationState | RuleState   | Explanation
----------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------
Unknown         | Unknown     | Job just received; not processed yet
Pending         | Pending     | Job queued
InProgress      | Pending     | Validation in progress
Passed          | InProgress  | Rule execution in progress
Failed          | NotRun      | Validation failed; rule processing cancelled
Passed          | Failed      | Rule execution failed
Passed          | Passed      | Rule execution successful

When the rule execution is completed successfully, an additional 'Summary' element is provided in the response. This aims to provide the same information as the email notification sent by Rapptr when a positions file finishes processing.

The Summary element is comprised of:

 * The total number of alerts by type - i.e. Breach, Unknown, etc.
 * The number of new alerts by type (since the day before).

        </Summary>
    </ResultsSnapshot>

### `POST /v1/portfolios/import` (Optional)

Upload Portfolio data, if your portfolio structure changes frequently you may wish to refresh this at an appropriate frequency. Use `/v1/portfolios/import?ignoreUnknownProperties=true` to ignore unknown properties, needed when uploading portfolio file exported from Rapptr. Expects CSV - [example file](Sample-ImportFiles/Portfolios.csv).

### `POST /v1/transactions/import` (Optional)

Upload Transaction data. Expects CSV - [example file](Sample-ImportFiles/Transactions.csv).

## Request Content-Types

When sending data to the API we expect certain content types to be set on your request e.g.

    POST https://%company%-api.fundapps.co/v1/expost/check HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: "application/xml"

These Content-Type values are as follows:

Input Type  | Content-Type
------------|-----------
CSV         | text/csv
XLS         | application/vnd.ms-excel
XLSX        | application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet
XML         | application/xml
ZIP         | application/zip

## Content Names

When uploading data to the API, it is stored and later displayed in Rapptr using a default file name. To specify a different file name, populate the "X-ContentName" header, e.g.

	POST https://%company%-api.fundapps.co/v1/expost/check HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: "application/xml" X-ContentName: "positions-monday.xml"

## Max File Size

When uploading via the API, we have a maximum allowed file size of approximately 100MB. If your file exceeds this size we suggest zipping it.

## Examples
We provide a number of example implementations against our API using commonly available programming languages and libraries in this repository.
