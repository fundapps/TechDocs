# Rapptr File Formats

## Portfolio Data

When uploading company structures and portfolios to Rapptr, we recommend that this is done at once using our CSV portfolio file template. You can find a [sample file here](https://github.com/fundapps/api-examples/blob/master/Sample-ImportFiles/Portfolios.csv) and a sample file with multiple aggregation structures [here](https://github.com/fundapps/api-examples/blob/master/Sample-ImportFiles/PortfoliosMultipleAggregationStructures.csv). For more guidance on how to structure your portfolio file, please refer to this [Help Centre article](https://fundapps.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210134023-Portfolio-File).

Please see [here](http://docs.fundapps.co/disclosureProperties.html#portfolioProperties) for the portfolio property descriptions 

*PortfolioId* needs to be unique. In the scenario where a PortfolioId is uploaded which already exists in Rapptr, the previous portfolio details associated with that PortfolioId will be overridden, so if any columns are blank (e.g. disclosure form properties, then existing values will be overridden)

## Transaction Data

We accept transaction data in CSV format. You can find a [sample file here](Transactions.csv).

### Data Requirements

- *Id* (or IssuerId) needs to be unique. In the scenario where an IssuerId is uploaded which already exists as part of the Issuer Register, this will result in a validation error.
- *Id* needs to match the IssuerId field the Position file; this is key in order to be able to query the correct issuer information for disclosure forms.

## Imported Disclosure Data
We accept information about imported disclosures in CSV format. You can find a [sample file here](https://github.com/fundapps/api-examples/blob/master/Sample-ImportFiles/Imported%20Disclosures.csv). Unlike the the other import files, these should be sent to support@fundapps.co as we upload directly into the databases.
