# Adapptr API@v2

ℹ See [here](../APIMigration.md) for a page detailing the API migration.

## Base URI

Your base URL for Adapptr is <https://%company%-svc.fundapps.co/api/adapptr>, e.g. `https://abc-svc.fundapps.co/api/adapptr`.

## Authentication

Authentication to the Adapptr API is done via [Basic Authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617) over HTTPS. A Rapptr administrator from your organisation must create a user with the role "API" for this purpose. You must authenticate for all requests.

**Note:** Please ensure you create a separate user for the API as if you use an existing user's account, as soon as they change their password the API upload will fail.

## Methods

For all methods, the header `X-Client-Environment` is required. This must be populated with the name of your FundApps environment.

For all methods, authentication is made against your FundApps environment. You are required to include the Username and Password of an API user in the FundApps environment you have set in the `X-Client-Environment` header.

### Available Nomenclatures `GET /v2/nomenclatures`

List of available data providers, identifier types, position services and more. Those can be requested from this endpoint. You must then use the appropriate ids for parameters in other requests.

| Id  | Data Provider |
| --- | ------------- |
| 1   | Refinitiv     |
| 2   | Bloomberg     |

| Id  | Identifier Type |
| --- | --------------- |
| 1   | Isin            |
| 2   | Sedol           |

| Id  | Positions Service                         |
| --- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 2   | Shareholding Disclosure                   |
| 4   | Position Limits                           |
| 6   | Shareholding Disclosure & Position Limits |

| Id  | File Data Formats |
| --- | --------------- |
| 1   | FundApps         |
| 2   | Consensys       |

### Data Provider Credentials `POST /v2/configuration/dataproviders/:providerId/credentials`

If you are using Refinitiv data you must submit your username and password to this endpoint. Before being able to post a file to Adapptr, your data provider credentials must be set. Your file upload will otherwise fail because FundApps will be unable to connect and authenticate against the data provider.

**Note:** This endpoint does not support Bloomberg data provider. The support team will have to use your Bloomberg generated certificate to enable Adapptr integration. Please contact `support@fundapps.co` or your Client Success Manager for more details.

e.g.
`{ "Username": "[Username]", "Password": "[Password]" }`

### Upload positions `POST /v2/task/positions`

Upload daily positions. This method expects a CSV format ([example Adapptr position files](../Sample-ImportFiles/)). The response includes a `taskId` and a `trackingEndpoint` that can then be polled via the GET method to monitor the progress of the task through the Adapptr service.  

The `positions` parameter must be the file that you need to upload.  

The `snapshotDate` parameter must be included as a parameter in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`. This is the snapshot date of the positions being uploaded in the csv file.

The `services` _[optional]_ parameter can be included if you need different from the default `Shareholding Disclosure` service. It expects the `Id` of a service(s), that could be obtained from the [Available Nomenclatures](#available-nomenclatures-get-v2nomenclatures) endpoint.

The `primaryIdentifier` _[optional]_ parameter can be included if you need to specify which identifier from your positions file you wish to use to query against the data provider. For example if a position has both ISIN and SEDOL this parameter indicates which of the two identifiers should be used when requesting data from your market data provider. If not populated, the default is ISIN. The value could be obtained from the [Available Nomenclatures](#available-nomenclatures-get-v2nomenclatures) endpoint.

The `secondaryIdentifier` _[optional]_ parameter can be included if you need to specify which identifier to fall back to if your primaryIdentifier is not populated. For example if your primaryIdentifier is set to 1 for ISIN and you have a position which doesn't have an ISIN but has a SEDOL, setting the secondaryIdentifier to 2 (SEDOL) would tell Adapptr to use SEDOL to query data from your market data provider if ISIN is not populated. By default this is empty. The value could be obtained from the [Available Nomenclatures](#available-nomenclatures-get-v2nomenclatures) endpoint.

The `excludeErroredAssets` _[optional]_ is a boolean parameter that can be set if you need to send the positions to Rapptr despite errors due to incomplete data from your market data provider. Default value: `false`

The `dataProvider` _[optional]_ is an integer parameter that can be set if you need to select a specific data provider. Default value is `1` (Refinitiv). A list of all supported providers can be obtained from the [Available Nomenclatures](#available-nomenclatures-get-v2nomenclatures) endpoint.

The `copyDownParentInstrumentData` _[optional]_ is a boolean parameter that can be set if you find the Bloomberg component data not complete enough. Setting the value to `true` will copy all data from the parent instrument to the instrument of the component. The resulting component instrument will be Equity. Default value: `false`

The `populateExecutionVenueWithMarket` _[optional]_ is a boolean parameter that can be set if you need to use your data provider's Market field to populate ExecutionVenue of your assets. Default value: `false`

### Upload positions without enrichment `POST /v2/task/positions/without-enrichment`)

This method converts the Consensys or Adapptr csv file format into the FundApps required format for the Position Limits service only. The response includes a taskId and a trackingEndpoint that can then be polled via the GET method to monitor the progress of the task through the Adapptr service.  

The `positions` parameter must be the file that you need to upload.  

The `snapshotDate` parameter must be included as a parameter in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`. This is the snapshot date of the positions being uploaded in the CSV file.

The `format` _[optional]_ _[default value = 2]_ parameter can be included if you prefer using different file data format. A list of all supported file data formats can be obtained from the [Available Nomenclatures](#available-nomenclatures-get-v2nomenclatures) endpoint.

This method works only with the FundApps Position Limits service. Please see [here](../Sample-ImportFiles/Position%20Limits) for an example.

### Task status `GET /v2/task/:taskID/status`

GET the task status. This method returns a status of the requested TaskId and if the task has failed, the errors that have contributed to the failure.

There are 4 status ids

| id  | status                    | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 6   | Waiting Extractions        | A request is sent to the data provider, but there is no response yet.                                                                                                             |
| 500 | Failed                    | Job has failed. Please read errors to identify cause of job failure.                                                                                                              |

Once transmitted, the request will give the Rapptr `trackingEndpoint` url which can be polled to check the status of the XML positions file upload to FundApps.
