# Adapptr API@v2

## Base URI

Your base URL for Adapptr is <https://%company%-svc.fundapps.co/api/adapptr>, e.g. `https://abc-svc.fundapps.co/api/adapptr`.

## Authentication

Authentication to the Adapptr API is done via [Basic Authentication](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617) over HTTPS. An administrator from your organisation must create a user with the role "API" for this purpose. You must authenticate for all requests.

**Note:** Please ensure you create a separate user for the API as if you use an existing user's account, as soon as they change their password the API upload will fail.

## Methods

For all methods, authentication is made against your FundApps environment. You are required to include the Username and Password of an API user in your FundApps environment.

### Available Nomenclatures `GET /v2/nomenclatures`

List of available data providers, identifier types, position services and more. Those can be requested from this endpoint. You must then use the appropriate ids for parameters in other requests.

| Id  | Data Provider |
| --- | ------------- |
| 1   | Refinitiv     |
| 2   | Bloomberg     |

| Id  | Identifier Type |
| --- | --------------- |
| 1   | Isin            |
| 2   | Sedol           |
| 3   | Cusip           |

| Id  | Positions Service                         |
| --- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 2   | Shareholding Disclosure                   |
| 4   | Position Limits                           |
| 6   | Shareholding Disclosure & Position Limits |

| Id  | File Data Formats |
| --- | --------------- |
| 1   | FundApps         |
| 2   | Consensys       |

### Data Provider Credentials `POST /v2/configuration/dataproviders/:providerId/credentials`

If you are using Refinitiv data you must submit your username and password to this endpoint. Before being able to post a file to Adapptr, your data provider credentials must be set. Your file upload will otherwise fail because FundApps will be unable to connect and authenticate against the data provider.

**Note:** This endpoint does not support Bloomberg data provider. The support team will have to use your Bloomberg generated certificate to enable Adapptr integration. Please contact `support@fundapps.co` or your Client Success Manager for more details.

e.g.
`{ "Username": "[Username]", "Password": "[Password]" }`

### Upload positions `POST /v2/task/positions`

Upload daily positions. This method expects a CSV format ([example Adapptr position files](../Sample-ImportFiles/)). The response includes a `taskId` and a `trackingEndpoint` that can then be polled via the GET method to monitor the progress of the task through the Adapptr service.  

The `positions` parameter must be the file that you need to upload.  

The `snapshotDate` parameter must be included as a parameter in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`. This is the snapshot date of the positions being uploaded in the csv file.

The `dataProvider` is an integer parameter that must be included to select a specific data provider. A list of all supported providers can be obtained from the [Available Nomenclatures](#available-nomenclatures-get-v2nomenclatures) endpoint.

The `services` _[optional]_ parameter can be included if you need different from the default `Shareholding Disclosure` service. It expects the `Id` of a service(s), that could be obtained from the [Available Nomenclatures](#available-nomenclatures-get-v2nomenclatures) endpoint.

The `primaryIdentifier` _[optional]_ parameter can be included if you need to specify which identifier from your positions file you wish to use to query against the data provider. For example if a position has both ISIN and SEDOL this parameter indicates which of the two identifiers should be used when requesting data from your market data provider. If not populated, the default is ISIN. The value could be obtained from the [Available Nomenclatures](#available-nomenclatures-get-v2nomenclatures) endpoint.

The `secondaryIdentifier` _[optional]_ parameter can be included if you need to specify which identifier to fall back to if your primaryIdentifier is not populated. For example if your primaryIdentifier is set to 1 for ISIN and you have a position which doesn't have an ISIN but has a SEDOL, setting the secondaryIdentifier to 2 (SEDOL) would tell Adapptr to use SEDOL to query data from your market data provider if ISIN is not populated. By default this is empty. The value could be obtained from the [Available Nomenclatures](#available-nomenclatures-get-v2nomenclatures) endpoint.

The `excludeErroredAssets` _[optional]_ is a boolean parameter that can be set if you need to send the positions despite errors due to incomplete data from your market data provider. Default value: `false`

The `copyDownParentInstrumentData` _[optional]_ is a boolean parameter that can be set if you find the Bloomberg component data not complete enough. Setting the value to `true` will copy all data from the parent instrument to the instrument of the component. The resulting component instrument will be Equity. Default value: `false`

The `populateExecutionVenueWithMarket` _[optional]_ is a boolean parameter that can be set if you need to use your data provider's Market field to populate ExecutionVenue of your assets. Default value: `false`

### Upload positions without enrichment `POST /v2/task/positions/without-enrichment`)

This method converts the Consensys or Adapptr csv file format into the FundApps required format for the Position Limits service only. The response includes a taskId and a trackingEndpoint that can then be polled via the GET method to monitor the progress of the task through the Adapptr service.  

The `positions` parameter must be the file that you need to upload.  

The `snapshotDate` parameter must be included as a parameter in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`. This is the snapshot date of the positions being uploaded in the CSV file.

The `format` _[optional]_ _[default value = 2]_ parameter can be included if you prefer using different file data format. A list of all supported file data formats can be obtained from the [Available Nomenclatures](#available-nomenclatures-get-v2nomenclatures) endpoint.

This method works only with the FundApps Position Limits service. Please see [here](../Sample-ImportFiles/Position%20Limits) for an example.

    }
}
```

## Power shell scripts 

As a helper to automate the setup and daily operations there are a group of power shell scripts provided that aim to help the process of upload daily positions files.
Those scripts create power shell functions to allow the use of the Adapptr APIs.

Once the functions are created, they can be used from the command line directly or integrated with other scripts created by client's own teams.

On the header of each script there is a description of how to use the functions created.

| script                    | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| check-task-status.ps1 | create a function that will call the [task status api](#task-status-get-v2tasktaskidstatus) to check a task status|
| post-data-provider-credentials.ps1 | create a function that will call the [data provider api](#data-provider-credentials-post-v2configurationdataprovidersprovideridcredentials) to registry the provider credentials |
| upload-positions-without-enrichment.ps1 | create functions that allow to submit positions file to run without enrichment [without enrichment api](#upload-positions-without-enrichment-post-v2taskpositionswithout-enrichment) |
| upload-positions.ps1 | create functions that allow to submit positions file to run with enrichment [enrichment api](#upload-positions-with-composite-enrichment-post-v2taskpositionsexpost) |
| entry-provider-credentials.ps1 | this script allow the use of [data provider api](#data-provider-credentials-post-v2configurationdataprovidersprovideridcredentials) asking the information required and submit the request to the API. The password requested will be obscured. |
